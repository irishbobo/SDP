# Fridge Maid app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

git fetch --gets updates from the remote repo to your repo WITHOUT changing your files
git add --adds files to be commited
git commit -m"Type a message" --this commits your added files to be pushed. be sure to add a message ALWAYS
git push --adds all the changes youve made to the remote repo
git pull --does a git fetch and git merge which will update your repo and change your code



Ok so some git hub basics
1.If you need help contact joseph or look it up on chat GPT
2. If u r a git noob DONT commit changes to main just yet 
3. An explanation. So imagine youve got a big coding project with multiple peopel involved spread throught the world. Yall need some way to coordinate you code. U dont want jimmy to be plugging away on something only to realize that hes implemented it differently from everyone else. So this is where git comes in you can upload multiple files to a "repo" for other people to look at and even change.
4. So how does it work? idk really but heres how I understnd it. the "main branch" is our primary "repo" that we "pull" from and "push" too. 
5. BRANCHES. Let me first explain "main branch" git is like a tree. it has a trunk that we call "main branch" and tiny little trunks that poke out from the main trunk called branches in english and in git they are also called "branches" usually you would have a branch because you dont want to do all your coding in main. Once your happy with your code and check with the git admin "i guess me joseph" you can merge your code into main and then that will be the code everyone "pulls" from.
6. PUSH AND PULL. so pulling is when you take updates from the "branch" your in that other people might have made. if jimmy stayed up all night coding when i wake up in the morning i can do a |git pull| and boom all my files will be updated with jimmies changes. Push is how jimmy uploaded his code. When your happy with your code you "push" it to the "branch"'s "repo" and now anyone can download it.
